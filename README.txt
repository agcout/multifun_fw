Scripts to run the framework used in Coutinho et al. 2024
Adaptive strategies for maximizing ecosystem multifunctionality:
a trait-based approach to species addition in ongoing restoration projects
###############################################################################

This is an initial version of the modifications on the framework proposed by
Coutinho et al. 2023 and ontain the scripts used to obtain the results in
Coutinho et al. 2024, above mentioned. As so, it may require modifications in the
scripts, if the user wants to use its own data. A package with this and other
modifications is under construction.

To use this framework, run the scripts in the following order:
1. Simulations.R. This script performs simulations for each density level
	defined. Each density correspond to one round. Note that,
	with a higher number of iterations (currently, 10000 for each density
	level), it may take a long time to complete all the simulation rounds.
	If the simulation is stopped, the results are not lost, as they
	are stored in the output folder, within the density level of the
	respective round. The file run_up_to indicates which was the last
	round. For the remaining rounds, the user can modify the "rouds"
	object.
2. bind_data.frames.R. Binds all the results generated in each round.
3. figures.R. Generates figures and results.

Objects in "outputs" folder contain all the outputs generated by the scripts
	above.

If you desire to run with your on data, we recommend making a copy of this
folder and replacing the csv files by your own files. Note that
"burned_sites.csv" contain information of sites were fire resilience should
be prioritized. This type of information is optional. If you need to
prioritize functions in given sites, this type of information will be
necessary, and the scripts must be modified accordingly.
